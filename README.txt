Research Overview:
Contemporary material characterisation techniques that leverage deformation fields and the weak form of the equilibrium equations face challenges in the numerical solution procedure of the inverse characterisation problem.  As material models and descriptions differ, so too must the approaches for identifying parameters and their corresponding mechanisms. The widely-used Ogden material model can be comprised of a chosen number of terms of the same mathematical form, which presents challenges of parsimonious representation, interpretability, and stability.  Robust techniques for system identification of any material model are important to assess and improve experimental design, in addition to their centrality to forward computations. Using fully 3D displacement fields acquired in silicone elastomers with our recently-developed magnetic resonance cartography (MR-u) technique on the order of ~20,000 points per sample, we leverage PDE-constrained optimisation as the basis of variational system identification of our material parameters. We incorporate the statistical F-test to maintain parsimony of representation.  Using a new, local deformation decomposition locally into mixtures of biaxial and uniaxial tensile states, we evaluate experiments based on an analytical sensitivity metric, and discuss the implications for experimental design.

		20220209-ogdenss_2moreloadsteps		Solid_Rectangular	2.5 mm & 5 mm
	- Due to size limitations, you'll have to visit https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sl29qNNzVtvLLefp_xoE7m4ru78bWVhV/view?usp=sharing and download the zip file.
	- Populate the DESTE_strains_RO_PE_SL_Ref_blurvec0.80.80.8.mat files into their respective experiment subdirectory (labeling in the zip file should help out)
	- Re-enter the parent directory of MR_Processing (or you may comment out 'cd(sampleName)' in the code)
	- Run runComplexFilter_Ogden
	- A file named 'disp_data_sampleName.mat' is produced in the respective sampleName subdirectory that contains the following information:
		F_t{t}{i,j}(x,y,z) 	- Deformation gradient tensor
					- t: displacement step (1 - 2.5 mm, 2 - 5 mm, 3 - 7 mm)
					- i,j: component of deformation gradient
					- x,y,z: voxel mesh grid indices
		E_t{t}{i,j}(x,y,z)	- Lagrange strain tensor
		U_t{t}{i}(x,y,z)	- Displacement vector
		mask(x,y,z)		- Mask of material
		prescribedU		- prescribedU values
		osc			- voxel resolution (mm/px)
	- A file named 'refpositions_sampleName.mat' is produced in the respective sampleName subdirectory that contains the following information:
		X{j}(x,y,z)		- Reference configuration positions
					- j: 1,2 or 3 coordinate axis direction

4. Simulation deformation gradients:
	- Open Abaqus2Matlab directory
	- Open DefGrad_sim_v9
	- Uncomment the following for 'curdir' variable to run for a particular sample:
		22-0201-5MM_Holes_SS	Holes_Rectangular Shear	2.5 mm & 5 mm
		22-0301-NoHoles_SS	Solid_Rectangular Shear	2.5 mm & 5 mm & 7 mm

		[Date]-Wavy_[Category]	Various Wavy Shear Sims	6.5 mm
	- A file named 'MRI-3Ddefs_SimpleShear_' curdir '.mat' is produced in the respective 'Simulations_tet\curdir' subdirectory and contains the deformation information on the deformation gradient and displacement of each element
	- A file named 'refpositions.mat' is produced in the respective 'Simulations_tet\curdir' subdirectory and contains information about the referenece configuration positions
	- Note: Abaqus simulations don't run by default, since the 'Data' files are already produced. If you'd like to inspect how Abaqus runs in MatLab, simply delete the folder with the respective data in the 'Data' subdirectory
	- Feel free to use your own input files from Abaqus to investigate DefGrad_sim_v9. Some guidelines to follow:
		Create a new case for 'curdir' and change the size/hole inclusion in genMesh within the subdirectory 'Functions\'
		An example of an inclusion of an Abaqus file is implemented for "Shear Wavy"
	- Note: This code runs for delaunay triangulation within MatLab and hence calculates the deformation gradients for quadratic tetrahedral elements
		+ For hexahedral elements, you'll need to use the files that are in the folders 'Old_hex' to run them
	- If you run into any unforeseen issues, feel free to contact Denislav Nikolov: dnikolov@umich.edu

5. Decoupling parameters and sensitivity metric quantification
	- Open Decomposition_Sensitivity directory
	- k and lambda decoupling of F_t:
		+ Load the MRI-3Ddefs_SimpleShear...mat file from the respective curdir subdirectory into MATLAB workspace
		+ Load og_matprop.mat
		+ Run one of the following inline function (depending on whether you'd like to use parfor or par):
			[k,lam,~,~,~] = param_decoup_nopar(F_t,og_matprop);
			[k,lam,~,~,~] = param_decoup_main(F_t,og_matprop);
			'k' and 'lam' contain information for the k and lambda decoupling for each voxel's deformation gradient
	- Sensitivity plots:
